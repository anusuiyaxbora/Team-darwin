# Getting Started


## Task for Stage_0
**The Spreadsheet Project**
* Each team should create a GitHub repo. 
* Add a comprehensive readme.md with essential information about the internship, the team, the contributors, pictures if possible using markdown.
* Each team will work on a minimum of  7 different programming languages
* For each person in a team, pick one of the 7 programming languages, Write a script that prints your name, your email, your slack username (with @) and your biostack in that order.
* Push the script to your team’s git repo
* Collaboratively as a team, develop a bash script that clones the git repo, and generates a CSV file from all the outputs of your team’s scripts
* Submit your team’s* GitHub link to only t*he bash script 
* The already exisiting code output, add an extra output that prints out your twitter handle (with @)
* Now, in another column output, calculate the output of the Hamming distance between your slack handle and twitter handle.
* The output for every team member should now be name, email, <slack_username> (with @) your biostack , <twitter_handle> and <hamming_distance> .
* Only the emails and slack handles that are on the CSV sheet generated by your script will be promoted to stage 1



## Workflow

**Step-wise Workflow**

## Output Template
A unified output template is necessary to extract the metadata from all the scripts in the team's repository and covert it into a csv file using a bash script. 
```bash
> Name,email@abc.com,@SlackUsername,BIOSTACK,@TwitterId,Hamming_distance  

*SlackId and TwitterId should cotain '@' symbol*
*All the details should have 'comma' as the only delimiter and contain no spaces.*
```
An example:
```bash
> Utkarsha,utkarshanp@gmail.com,@Utkarsha12,TRANSRIPTOMICS,@Utkar-sha5,0
```
**After obtaining the desired output, please name the file script_Slack-username_ <br> An example:** 
`script_Utkarsha12.pl`

## New to Coding 
Almost all of the team members had no or very little programming knowledge, the task given was very simple and we were able to complete it by searching the web for "Hello World script" in the *language_of_interest* or following videos on youtube. If you are complete newbie to programming, you can try learning R or python, they are widely used  languages in bioinformatics. 
You can have a look at `script_mariangeles.R` or `script_Ifemide.py` to get familiar with these languages.
