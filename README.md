# Getting Started
## Prerequisite installations
- [Python language](https://www.python.org/)
- [GCC and G++ compilers](https://gcc.gnu.org/). Available via standard package managers
- [R language](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
- Linux (awk command must be recognisable in shell)
- [Perl](https://www.perl.org/)
- [MATLAB](https://in.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html) for MATLAB online
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

## Running the tests

## Installation

## Task for Stage_0

## Workflow

## Languages
- [x] Python
- [x] Ruby
- [x] C++
- [x] R 
- [x] Java
- [x] MATLAB
- [x] Perl

## Output Template
A unified output template is necessary to extract the metadata from all the scripts in the team's repository into a csv file. 
```bash
> Name,email@abc.com,@SlackUsername,BIOSTACK,@TwitterId,Hamming_distance  

*SlackId and TwitterId should cotain '@' symbol*
*All the details should have 'comma' as the only delimiter and contain no spaces.*
```
An example:
```bash
> Utkarsha,utkarshanp@gmail.com,@Utkarsha12,TRANSRIPTOMICS,@Utkar-sha5
```
**After obtaining the desired output, please name the file script_Slack-username_ <br> An example:** 
`script_Utkarsha12.pl`

## New to Coding 
Almost all of the team members had no or very little programming knowledge, the task given was very simple and we were able to complete it by searching the web for "Hello World script" in the *language_of_interest* or following videos on youtube. If you are complete newbie to programming, you can try learning R or python, they are widely used  languages in bioinformatics. 
You can have a look at `script_mariangeles.R` or `script_Ifemide.py` to get familiar with these languages.
